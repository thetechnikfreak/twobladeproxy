# Twoblade Proxy

This proxy connects **[Twoblade](https://twoblade.com/)** (and clones), an email service built by [FaceDev](https://github.com/face-hh), and uses SHARP instead of the usual email protocol for normal email communication.
## Try out my Instance  
To send a mail from Twoblade to an normal email adress just mail `mail#twoblade.com` **with youre Receiver Email being youre Subject**.

For the other way around email `outbound.mailproxy@gmail.com` **with also youre Receiver Email being youre Subject**.
### Notice
It can take up to 1 Minute for mails to arrive and my Acc on **[Twoblade](https://twoblade.com/)** Word lenght is limited to **5 ** so every Email with longer Words wont go throw!

### Thanks
Thanks to [FaceDEV](https://github.com/face-hh) for youre intresting Email Provider
and [Rose](https://github.com/rosegoldd) for helping auth with auth and the hashcode.
